### First Come First Serve(FCFS)
- First Come First Serve (FCFS) is a CPU scheduling algorithm in which processes are executed on FCFS basis.
- The request or process which comes first in the ready queue is being executed first.
- It is simple, easy-to-understand & easy-to-implement but poor in performance as average waiting time is high.
